# FM MoneyBall app
This app allows users to import player data from Football Manager, generating a detailed table with advanced filtering options for deeper analysis of player statistics in Football Manager 2024.

## Description
This app is designed to enhance the analysis of player data exported from Football Manager. Users can import large datasets of player statistics directly into the app, which then generates a detailed table for each player, displaying various statistics.
The app provides advanced filtering options, allowing users to search and sort players in a more detailed and flexible way than what is possible within Football Manager itself. This makes it easier to identify key players and gain deeper insights into player performance across multiple metrics.
## Future Features
In future versions of the app, we aim to implement advanced player statistics, focusing on both defensive and offensive aspects of the game.
The idea is to aggregate various defensive metrics (such as tackles, interceptions, blocks, and clearances) and calculate a comprehensive score for each player.
This score will reflect the player's performance in different facets of the game, allowing for a more detailed analysis of individual contributions on the field.
